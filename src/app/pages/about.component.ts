            <p>
              Founded in 2024, Social App emerged from a simple idea: social media should 
              enhance real relationships, not replace them. Our team of passionate developers 
              and designers set out to create a platform that prioritizes authentic connections 
              over superficial metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we continue to innovate and evolve, always keeping our users' needs and 
              well-being at the center of everything we do. We're not just building an app; 
              we're fostering a community where everyone belongs.
